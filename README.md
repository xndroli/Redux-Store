## üîó Description <a name = "description"></a>

React's Context API is quickly gaining traction as a worthy alternative or perhaps even successor to other libraries that manage global state in tandem with React, such as Flux or MobX. Nonetheless, the open-source JavaScript library Redux remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application, and it‚Äôs very likely that you‚Äôll encounter it on the job.

I will refactor the e-commerce platform from a previous project so that it uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). I won‚Äôt need to make sweeping changes to the code, but I will need to read through the Redux documentation on my own to find the information needed for a successful refactor.

I will deploy the refactored application via Heroku.

## üí° User Story <a name = "user_story"></a>

```md
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

## ‚õìÔ∏è Acceptance Criteria <a name = "acceptance_criteria"></a>

```md
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the app‚Äôs store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
```
